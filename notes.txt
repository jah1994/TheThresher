Had an unnecessary upscaling operation as part of the image integer-pixel-shift alignment stage.
This was returning image offsets at an uneccesarily high precision (2 decimal places).
The net effect of removing the feature is that, compared to previous tests, image shifts may now differ by 1 pixel
in either x or y directions due to previous rounding errors (e.g. 2.65 -> 2, rather than 3).
Since the kernel objects are generously sized, this should have no consequential effect on
any prior results - the central power of the kernel will shift by a pixel, or at most,
sqrt(2) pixels.
